## filter out paths you never want under the android tree
## also skips the kernel paths.  If you want the kernel, use akfind
## 
## -path -prune seems to work on paths that are at the "start" of the tree,
## but fails on paths in the middle... ie, ./out/* comes out, but 
## blah/blah/.git/blah/blah i can't remove.
